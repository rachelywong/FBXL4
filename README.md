3D Modelling of FBXL4 Disease Protein Coding Gene

Protein modelling of disease protein coding gene FBXL4 using homology modelling from SWISS-Model. The final model can be viewed and edited with PyMol.Mutations were highlighted and labelled in the model based on type (missense, nonsense, insertion/deletion, etc).

The final FBXL4 protein modelling file can be found in FBXL4Mutations.pse
